                        This is a website designed to compile all of my original character content for LVSN (temporarily
                        titled Ellie Harris vs the Vampires), from plot relevant information, to art archives, to paper
                        crafts!

                        LVSN is my narrative story primarily about three vampire hunters and how their journey's have
                        led them astray:

                        vampirism, and <a href="mnoelle.html">Noelle Bergund</a>, her teammate who's kindness and
                        naivety made her a perfect
