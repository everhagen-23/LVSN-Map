                        This is a website designed to compile all of my original character content for LVSN (temporarily
                        titled Ellie Harris vs the Vampires), from plot relevant information, to art archives, to paper
                        crafts!

                    <p>
                        LVSN is my narrative story primarily about three vampire hunters and how their journey's have
                        led them astray:

                        of vampire hunters, however in turn they are surrounded my a large vampire population. In order
                        to keep their town's growth strong they take in lots of orphans or family's with strange pasts
                        and urge them to aid in the fight. Ellie Harris is one of these orphans, with her hometown and
                        family being torn apart after her brother's turning, and takes on vampires with her teammates,
                        Noelle and <a href="aj.html">AJ</a>, and coach, <span class="note"><a href="coach.html">[she
