                        <p> - All vampires are granted one unique ability, or "soul trait," in addition to physical
                            traits, as a result of the vampiric soul taking over their body. Vampire souls never die,
                            and instead reinhabit different bodies, gaining slightly altered traits over time. The more
                            a body is equipped to take on a given soul the stronger a vampire's soul trait will be*.
                            - **i.e.**: A vampiric soul with [electrical soul traits] may take on 2 bodies in the span
                            of 100 years. The first body does not mesh well with the soul and is bestowed with [great
                            static electricity powers]. Although this can be used semi-effectively the vampire is killed
                            within 9 years. After 15 years the vampiric soul is implanted into another body, one that
                            meshes much better with this specific soul. This vampire is bestowed with </p>

                        <p> - A vampire has an entirely different personality from their host body, they retain the
                            memories and skills of their host, however it is more like watching a TV show of their host
                            as opposed to actually being them. They do not retain memories from their vampiric soul's
                            previous bodies, however they may be more prone to certain outlooks and personality traits.
                            - Due to their demonic nature, vampires are inherently and irreversibly prone to have a
                            taste for desolation and evil, and are unable to ever fully quell this desire. They
                            naturally tend to hunt/live in group environments, with the strongest vampires either
                            leading packs of lesser vampires or hunting on their own. Lesser vampires rarely fight each
                            other, however stronger vampires will fight for leadership or land. </p>

                        <p> Although vampires can only die by certain means they still can have injuries that result in
                            lifelong disability, for instance, a vampire who's arm was cut off would not need to seek
                            immediate medical attention, but their arm would NOT grow back. The arm can technically act
                            on its own until the body is disposed of, provided it finds a way to supply itself with
                            enough blood. Severed limbs can be reattached but, unless the link to the main body's brain
                            is surgically reformed, it will not share the same thoughts as the original. Smaller cuts
                            and injuries will heal more rapidly than an average human, but healing will still take some
                            time. A death by blood starvation is sped up if too much blood is lost in the event of an
                            injury, but this is rare (basically it's the equivalent of starving to death because your
                            stomach was cut open). Vampires cannot be poisoned in any way that would result in death,
                            and all other poisons are quickly wiped from the bloodstream. </p>
