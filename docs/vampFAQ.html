                    The way my vampires work are a little different than your standard fantasy vampire (more of a
                    mismash of a couple tropes). Here's where I can set the record straight!

                    <p> Each and every vampire is granted 1 special ability, which is rooted in it's soul and adapts
                        to the rest of it's body. Whenver a soul <a href="#prime"> reincarnates</a> the crux of the
                        soul power will remain the same, however the specifics will vary. The vampiric ability will
                        be stronger the more equipped a mortal body is to take on a vampiric soul.</p>
                    <h3> Example: </h3>
                    <p>A vampiric soul with root electrical powers may take on two mortal bodies in the span of 150
                        years. The first body <strong>doesn't mesh well</strong> with the soul and is bestowed with
                        <strong>great
                            static electricity </strong>, not useless but certainly not the most powerful
                        either. This vampire goes about it's life, but due to it's below-par powers is quickly put
                        out of its misery within the decade. After 30 or so years the vampiric soul is implanted
                        into another mortal body, and this time, they <strong>do mesh well</strong>. As a result,
                        the body is
                        bestowed with <strong> thunderstorm control </strong>, a much better power. This vampire
                        proceeds to do much better for itself, killing and pillaging and whatnot for the next 110
                        years.
                    </p>
                    <section><br> Obviously this is not the only factor in making a vampire strong (in fact, a
                        cunning vampire can make more good out of a bad power than a stupid vampire could with a
                        good power), but good soul-body cohesion certainly makes being strong much easier.</p>

                    <p> Vampires have entirely different personalities than their mortal counterparts, however they
                        retain all memories from their past (think of it like watching a TV show, you can see all the
                        characters but some of their innermost thoughts are off limits / can only be implied).It can
                        take up to a week for a vampire to catch up on all their past memories. Some vampires resent
                        their past selves (see <a href="noelle.html"> Noelle Bergund </a>) and some cherish them (see <a
                            href="drac.html"> Drac</a>).</p>
                    <h3>Inherent Traits</h3>
                    <li>Due to their demonic nature, to some degree, all vampires are intristically evil. It sucks but
                        it is what it is I guess. Some rare vampires will try to fight this, but they are never able to
                        fully contain the urge.</li>
                    <li> Vampires typically tend to hunt and live in groups, as it is more
                        benefical for survival, with stronger vampires heading the group and lesser vampires getting the
                        assurance of a small meal at the end of each day. The stronger a vampire is the more likely they
                        are to deviate from this pattern of behavior.</li>

                    <p> Although vampires can only die by certain means they still can have injuries that result in
                        lifelong disability, for instance, a vampire who's arm was cut off would not need to seek
                        immediate medical attention, but their arm would NOT grow back. The arm can technically act
                        on its own until the body is disposed of, provided it finds a way to supply itself with
                        enough blood. Severed limbs can be reattached but, unless the link to the main body's brain
                        is surgically reformed, it will not share the same thoughts as the original. Smaller cuts
                        and injuries will heal more rapidly than an average human, but healing will still take some
                        time. A death by blood starvation is sped up if too much blood is lost in the event of an
                        injury, but this is rare (basically it's the equivalent of starving to death because your
                        stomach was cut open). Vampires cannot be poisoned in any way that would result in death,
                        and all other poisons are quickly wiped from the bloodstream. </p>
