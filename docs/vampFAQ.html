                    <div class="cCont">
                        <p> Each and every vampire is granted 1 special ability, which is rooted in it's soul and adapts
                            to the rest of it's body. Whenver a soul <a href="#prime"> reincarnates</a> the crux of the
                            soul power will remain the same, however the specifics will vary. The vampiric ability will
                            be stronger the more equipped a mortal body is to take on a vampiric soul.</p>
                        <h3> Example: </h3>
                        <p>A vampiric soul with root electrical powers may take on two mortal bodies in the span of 150
                            years. The first body <strong>doesn't mesh well</strong> with the soul and is bestowed with
                            <strong>great
                                static electricity </strong>, not useless but certainly not the most powerful
                            either. This vampire goes about it's life, but due to it's below-par powers is quickly put
                            out of its misery within the decade. After 30 or so years the vampiric soul is implanted
                            into another mortal body, and this time, they <strong>do mesh well</strong>. As a result,
                            the body is
                            bestowed with <strong> thunderstorm control </strong>, a much better power. This vampire
                            proceeds to do much better for itself, killing and pillaging and whatnot for the next 110
                            years.
                        </p>
                        <section><br> Obviously this is not the only factor in making a vampire strong (in fact, a
                            cunning vampire can make more good out of a bad power than a stupid vampire could with a
                            good power), but good soul-body cohesion certainly makes being strong much easier.</p>

                        <p> - A vampire has an entirely different personality from their host body, they retain the
                            memories and skills of their host, however it is more like watching a TV show of their host
                            as opposed to actually being them. They do not retain memories from their vampiric soul's
                            previous bodies, however they may be more prone to certain outlooks and personality traits.
                            - Due to their demonic nature, vampires are inherently and irreversibly prone to have a
                            taste for desolation and evil, and are unable to ever fully quell this desire. They
                            naturally tend to hunt/live in group environments, with the strongest vampires either
                            leading packs of lesser vampires or hunting on their own. Lesser vampires rarely fight each
                            other, however stronger vampires will fight for leadership or land. </p>

                    <div class="cCont">
                        <p> Although vampires can only die by certain means they still can have injuries that result in
                            lifelong disability, for instance, a vampire who's arm was cut off would not need to seek
                            immediate medical attention, but their arm would NOT grow back. The arm can technically act
                            on its own until the body is disposed of, provided it finds a way to supply itself with
                            enough blood. Severed limbs can be reattached but, unless the link to the main body's brain
                            is surgically reformed, it will not share the same thoughts as the original. Smaller cuts
                            and injuries will heal more rapidly than an average human, but healing will still take some
                            time. A death by blood starvation is sped up if too much blood is lost in the event of an
                            injury, but this is rare (basically it's the equivalent of starving to death because your
                            stomach was cut open). Vampires cannot be poisoned in any way that would result in death,
                            and all other poisons are quickly wiped from the bloodstream. </p>
