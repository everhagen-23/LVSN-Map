                    The way my vampires work are a little different than your standard fantasy vampire (more of a
                    mismash of a couple tropes). Here's where I can set the record straight!

                    <p> Each and every vampire is granted 1 special ability, which is rooted in it's soul and adapts
                        to the rest of it's body. Whenver a soul <a href="#prime"> reincarnates</a> the crux of the
                        soul power will remain the same, however the specifics will vary. The vampiric ability will
                        be stronger the more equipped a mortal body is to take on a vampiric soul.</p>
                    <h3> Example: </h3>
                    <p>A vampiric soul with root electrical powers may take on two mortal bodies in the span of 150
                        years. The first body <strong>doesn't mesh well</strong> with the soul and is bestowed with
                        <strong>great
                            static electricity </strong>, not useless but certainly not the most powerful
                        either. This vampire goes about it's life, but due to it's below-par powers is quickly put
                        out of its misery within the decade. After 30 or so years the vampiric soul is implanted
                        into another mortal body, and this time, they <strong>do mesh well</strong>. As a result,
                        the body is
                        bestowed with <strong> thunderstorm control </strong>, a much better power. This vampire
                        proceeds to do much better for itself, killing and pillaging and whatnot for the next 110
                        years.
                    </p>
                    <section><br> Obviously this is not the only factor in making a vampire strong (in fact, a
                        cunning vampire can make more good out of a bad power than a stupid vampire could with a
                        good power), but good soul-body cohesion certainly makes being strong much easier.</p>

                        <h3>Prime Vampires</h3>
                        <p>Prime Vampires are the strongest of the strong, and occur when a mortal host body and a
                            vampiric
                            soul have the maximum possible compatibility. They have powers that are considered the
                            height of
                            the soul, and are given special eyes to reflect this power. Obviously not all prime vampires
                            are
                            going to be stronger than a non-prime vampire, consider a prime rain soul vs an average
                            super
                            analysis soul, but they tend to be the strongest of that soul's capabilties.</p>

                </button>
                <div class="cCont">
                    <p> Vampires have entirely different personalities than their mortal counterparts, however they
                        retain all memories from their past (think of it like watching a TV show, you can see all the
                        characters but some of their innermost thoughts are off limits / can only be implied). It can
                        take up to a week for a vampire to catch up on all their past memories. Some vampires resent
                        their past selves (see <a href="noelle.html"> Noelle Bergund </a>) and some cherish them (see <a
                            href="drac.html"> Drac</a>).</p>
                    <h3>Inherent Traits</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Due to their demonic nature, to some degree, all vampires are intristically evil. It sucks
                            but
                            it is what it is I guess. Some rare vampires will try to fight this, but they are never able
                            to
                            fully contain the urge.</li>
                        <li>Vampires typically tend to hunt and live in groups, as it is more
                            benefical for survival, with stronger vampires heading the group and lesser vampires getting
                            the
                            assurance of a small meal at the end of each day. The stronger a vampire is the more likely
                            they
                            are to deviate from this pattern of behavior.</li>
                        <li>Vampires have an inherent aversion to anything that would kill them, i.e. crosses, garlic,
                            etc.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>VK-7</h3>
                    <p> Due to vampire pack mentality a collection of the strongest of the strong formed, headed by the
                        Vampire King, Elliot Harris. Each member reports to him, however they are rarely summoned for
                        tasks and are allowed to get up to whatever they so wish in their spare time. To ascend the
                        ranks a vampire must kill and replace a pre-existing member, and will take their ranking in
                        turn. Once in the VK-7, ranking can be adjusted by the Vampire King's judgement.

                    <h3>Reincarnation</h3>
                    <p>Gamers don't die, they respawn. Well that's not true but if you're a vampiric soul its not
                        entirely inaccurate. When a vampire's host body is defeated the soul will evacuate, re-entering
                        the queue to be given a host body once more. When it enters it's next host body it will have no
                        memories from its past incarnations, however certain personality traits have a tendency to stick
                        with the same souls.</p>

                <div class="cCont">
                    <p>Vampire blood is not just recycled mortal blood, after blood has circulated through a vampire's
                        body it becomes toxic to all other vampires and, in large enough concentrations, the original
                        vampire.<strong>Vampire blood can be dispelled from the body in multiple ways</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Healing in non-fatal spots</li>
                        <li>Use of special abilities</li>
                        <li>Blood loss, intentional or unintentional</li>
                        <li> Mortal blood usuage, i.e. blushing or just slow use overtime to maintain the body.</li>
                    </ul></br>
                    <p>This toxic effect makes vampire blood a powerful tool for both hunters and vampires alike,
                        however it is hard to get ahold of, as it boils and steams away when it makes contact with the
                        air. It isn't uncommon to vampires to cut and fling blood at each other when they have
                        skirmishes.</p>
                    <h3>Overflow</h3>
                    <p>
                        Overflow, or oversaturation, occurs when a vampire has too much blood in their system, and
                        causes
                        them to slowly burn from the inside out. A vampire is their strongest in this form, however they
                        are
                        also on a very strict time limit, so very few choose this as a strategy. It takes a lot of blood
                        to get to this point, so rookie vampires will rarely find themselves in this predicament,
                        however it tends to be an issue to middle level vampires, who have a stable enough food source,
                        however don't use their powers as much, leading to an oversaturation of blood in their systems.
                        To prevent this, these vampires tend to intentionally blood let, so that way they never have to
                        take any emergency measures.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Healing</h3>
                    <p>
                        Vampires can heal themselve faster than the average mortal, but they can't regenerate
                        infinitely. For instance, if a vampire had their arm slashed off they would be able to heal over
                        the open wound to stop blood loss, but they would walk away with a stump in it's place, not a
                        fully regrown arm. Due to the demonic nature of vampire, a fallen arm is not inherently dead, as
                        long as the host's soul is still intact, and will gain a semi-conciousness of it's own.
                        Obviously most fallen limbs, in their brainless states, are not going to be able to fashion
                        themselves a system for acquiring blood, but if they are they will be able to live. Chopped
                        limbs cannot be resewn on, as they will still have a concious of their own, and may be more of a
                        hinderance than a help.
